    <p>
        Being a student often means juggling classes, assignments, exams, and maybe even part-time work. 
        With such a packed schedule, fitness can feel like an afterthought. But here’s the truth: 
        <strong>staying healthy doesn’t require endless hours at the gym</strong>. With a little planning 
        and consistency, you can stay fit and energized while still keeping up with your studies.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Make Fitness Part of Your Routine</h2>
    <p>
        Instead of waiting for the “perfect” time to exercise, schedule it the same way you would 
        a class or study session. Even <strong>15–20 minutes of movement a day</strong> adds up. 
        Short bursts of exercise during study breaks can actually improve your focus, memory, and energy levels.
    </p>
    <p><em>Tip:</em> Set a reminder on your phone or calendar. Treat your workout as a non-negotiable appointment with yourself.</p>

    <h2>2. Do Quick, Effective Workouts</h2>
    <p>
        You don’t need fancy equipment or a gym membership. Bodyweight exercises are perfect for dorms, bedrooms, 
        or even outside between classes. The key is efficiency—pick moves that engage multiple muscle groups 
        and get your heart rate up.
    </p>

    <h3>Sample 15-Minute Dorm Workout</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Push-Ups</strong> – 10–15 reps</li>
        <li><strong>Squats</strong> – 15 reps</li>
        <li><strong>Plank</strong> – 20–30 seconds</li>
        <li><strong>Jumping Jacks</strong> – 1 minute</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Repeat 2–3 times. That’s a full workout in under 20 minutes, no equipment needed.</p>

    <h2>3. Eat Smart (Fuel Your Brain & Body)</h2>
    <p>
        As a student, it’s tempting to grab instant noodles, fast food, or energy drinks while cramming. 
        But your diet has a direct impact on your fitness, focus, and overall health. 
        Eating well doesn’t mean complicated meal prep—it means smarter choices.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Balanced meals</strong> → include protein, vegetables, and whole grains.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy snacks</strong> → fruits, nuts, yogurt, or granola bars over chips and candy.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay hydrated</strong> → drink water instead of soda or too much coffee.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Pro tip:</em> Keep healthy snacks in your bag or dorm so you don’t default to vending machines.</p>

    <h2>4. Don’t Sacrifice Sleep</h2>
    <p>
        All-nighters may seem like a badge of honor, but poor sleep weakens your immune system, 
        slows down recovery, and kills your focus. Sleep is not wasted time—it’s <strong>the best recovery tool</strong> 
        for both your body and brain. Aim for at least 7 hours of quality sleep whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p><em>Remember:</em> A rested student performs better in both fitness and academics.</p>

    <h2>5. Stay Active in Small Ways</h2>
    <p>
        Fitness isn’t just about workouts—it’s also about movement throughout your day. 
        Small, consistent choices keep your body active even when you’re busy.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Walk or bike to class if possible.</li>
        <li>Take the stairs instead of the elevator.</li>
        <li>Stretch while reading or reviewing notes.</li>
        <li>Stand and move during study breaks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        Being a busy student doesn’t mean you can’t stay fit. With quick workouts, smarter food choices, 
        better sleep, and small daily habits, you can balance both academics and health. 
        Remember: <strong>fitness isn’t about having extra time—it’s about making the most of the time you already have.</strong>

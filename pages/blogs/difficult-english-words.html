      English is full of words that look complicated, sound intimidating, or feel like they only belong in academic papers.  
      But the truth is, many of these “hard words” have very clear meanings once you break them down.  
      Here are some of the ones I find most interesting — explained simply, with real examples so you can actually use them.
    </p>

    <!-- WORDS -->
    <h2>Words You’ll Actually Want to Use</h2>
    <ul class="useful-sites-list">

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Obfuscate</strong> – To make something unclear on purpose.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ephemeral</strong> – Lasting only a short time.  
        <em>Example:</em> Sunsets are beautiful but ephemeral — they don’t last long.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ineffable</strong> – Too great to describe in words.  
        <em>Example:</em> The view from the mountain peak was ineffable.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serendipity</strong> – A lucky discovery by accident.

      <li>
        <strong>Cacophony</strong> – A harsh mix of sounds.  
        <em>Example:</em> The busy street was full of cacophony — honking cars and loud voices.

        <em>Example:</em> He was magnanimous in defeat and congratulated his opponent.

        <strong>Pernicious</strong> – Extremely harmful in a subtle way.

    </ul>

    <p>
      These words might seem “deep” at first glance, but they’re surprisingly approachable once you’ve seen them in action.  
      The key is not to memorize them just for the sake of it — try using them naturally in your writing or conversations.  
      A little practice goes a long way.

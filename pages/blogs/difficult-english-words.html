      English is full of words that look complicated, sound intimidating, or feel like they only belong in academic papers.  
      But the truth is, many of these “hard words” have very clear meanings once you break them down.  
      Here are some of the ones I find most interesting — explained simply, with real examples so you can actually use them.

      These words might seem “deep” at first glance, but they’re surprisingly approachable once you’ve seen them in action.  
      The key is not to memorize them just for the sake of it — try using them naturally in your writing or conversations.  
      A little practice goes a long way.
